# 💻 Artifact 1 – Software Design & Engineering  
**Project:** Weight Tracker Android App  

---

## 🧩 Description
This Android application allows users to log, edit, and track their weight over time, with the ability to set and compare progress toward a goal weight.  
Originally developed for **CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming**, the app was enhanced in **CS-499** to improve architecture, scalability, and maintainability.

---

## ⚙️ Enhancements
- Added a **DataRepository.java** class to separate data handling from UI logic (MVVM-style design).  
- Created a **Weight.java** model class for better data encapsulation.  
- Improved UI responsiveness by refreshing RecyclerView on data changes.  
- Implemented shared preferences to persist user goals between sessions.  

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Software design principles (modular architecture, abstraction, data encapsulation).  
- Use of Android SDK, SQLite, and RecyclerView adapter pattern.  
- Implementation of UX/UI best practices and persistent storage.  
- Application of object-oriented programming and documentation.
