# ⚙️ Artifact 2 – Algorithms & Data Structures  
**Project:** CS-300 Course Planner  

---

## 🧩 Description
This C++ console application helps academic advisors at ABC University manage and display course data efficiently.  
The program loads course information, displays all courses, and allows searching for individual courses and their prerequisites.

---

## ⚙️ Enhancements
- Optimized search and retrieval efficiency by replacing linear search with a **hash-table (unordered_map)** structure.  
- Improved time complexity from **O(n)** to **O(1)** average lookup.  
- Enhanced input validation, error handling, and file parsing logic.  
- Refactored the `Course` struct and menu system for cleaner modular design.  

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Algorithmic design and performance analysis (Big-O notation).  
- Implementation and use of **data structures**: vectors, maps, iterators.  
- Modular program design and input handling.  
- Emphasis on readability, maintainability, and documentation.
