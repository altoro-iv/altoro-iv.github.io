# 💾 Artifact 3 – Databases  
**Project:** Weight Tracker Android App (Database Layer)

## 🧩 Description
This artifact focuses on the database component of the Weight Tracker app.  
Originally, database logic was embedded directly within the activity classes.  
The enhancement modularized and optimized database interactions through abstraction.

## ⚙️ Enhancements
- Improved **DatabaseHelper.java** to include parameterized queries, reducing SQL injection risk.  
- Integrated **DataRepository.java** to centralize data access.  
- Ensured persistent data integrity using SQLite transactions.  
- Added goal-tracking functionality using **SharedPreferences**.  

---

## 🎯 Skills Demonstrated
- Database normalization and structured querying (SQLite).  
- Secure data handling and parameterized SQL queries.  
- Abstraction and modularization through repository design pattern.  
- Integration of database logic into a cohesive mobile application.
