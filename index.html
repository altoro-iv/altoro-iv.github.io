        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><strong>Hello there!</strong> I'm currently finishing up my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Southern New Hampshire University.
        I'm passionate about learning, whether it's through school, doing <a href="https://theodinproject.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">The Odin Project</a>, 
        or going through the career paths on <a href="https://codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer"> Codecademy</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm big into full-stack web development, mobile apps, and creating tools that help people achieve their goals. One of my big goals is to launch my own fitness app.
            Something fun and gamified to help people that are new to fitness stick with it. I love learning and always looking for the next opportunity to learn and apply something new.
        </p>
