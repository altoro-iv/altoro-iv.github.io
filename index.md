# 👋 Welcome to My Computer Science ePortfolio

Hello, and welcome to my professional ePortfolio for **CS-499: Computer Science Capstone**.  
This portfolio represents the culmination of my work at **Southern New Hampshire University**, showing my growth and technical ability across software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

## 🌟 Professional Self-Assessment

Completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at **Southern New Hampshire University** has been both a technical and personal journey. When I began, my experience was limited to small coding assignments; now I can plan, develop, and document complete software solutions.  
This ePortfolio highlights that growth through three core areas: **software design and engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, and **database management**—the foundation of my work as an aspiring backend or software developer.

### 🚀 Growth Through the Program
Across courses such as **CS-260**, **CS-300**, **CS-360**, and **CS-405**, I learned to analyze complex problems and translate them into scalable, secure, and efficient programs. My **Weight Tracker App** and **Course Planner** projects show how I evolved from writing functional code to applying modular design, encapsulation, and performance optimization.

### 🤝 Collaboration and Communication
Instructor feedback and the required **code review** helped me explain technical decisions clearly and document my work professionally. These experiences mirror industry collaboration—sharing code through GitHub, writing clear documentation, and presenting technical updates to both developers and non-technical audiences.

### ⚙️ Algorithms and Data Structures
In my **CS-300 Course Planner**, I applied algorithmic thinking by introducing a hash-table for faster lookups, improving performance from O(n) to O(1). This enhancement demonstrates my ability to evaluate trade-offs, optimize data flow, and design efficient computing solutions.

### 💻 Software Engineering and Databases
The **Weight Tracker App** demonstrates my understanding of modern software architecture. Enhancements such as adding a `DataRepository` class, refining `DatabaseHelper`, and introducing persistent goal tracking improved maintainability, reusability, and security. These upgrades align with real-world backend development practices and demonstrate my ability to connect UI design with secure data handling.

### 🔒 Security Mindset
Throughout my projects, I applied secure-coding principles from **CS-405**, including input validation, parameterized queries, and safe data storage. Anticipating vulnerabilities early in design has become a consistent habit that shapes all my development decisions.

### 🎯 Professional Goals
My short-term goal is to transition into a **backend or software developer role with Kohl’s**, where I currently work in operations. Long term, I plan to specialize in **cloud-based systems** using AWS and Spring Boot while pursuing certifications in **AWS Cloud Practitioner** and **Java Programming**.

### 🧭 Conclusion
This ePortfolio demonstrates how I have grown into a capable, security-minded, and detail-oriented developer. Each artifact shows measurable improvement in design quality, efficiency, and professional communication—evidence that I am prepared to contribute effectively to any modern software development team.
